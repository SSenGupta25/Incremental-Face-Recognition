# Incremental-Face-Recognition

🌟 Excited to share my latest project on Incremental Learning Based Face Recognition! 🌟

📌 **Project Title**: Incremental Learning-Based Face Recognition System
🔍 **Objective**: Develop a dynamic face recognition system that continuously adapts to new faces without needing complete retraining.
🚀 **Key Features**:
- **Continuous Learning**: Updates model with new data, adapting to new faces and changes over time.
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Minimizes computational power needed for updates.
- **Adaptability**: Ideal for dynamic environments with new or changing facial features.

🔧 **Technologies Used**:
- **Deep Learning Models**: MobileNetV2, FaceNet512
- **Libraries**: DeepFace, MTCNN, Dlib, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
- **Dataset**: VGGFace2 with 3.31 million images

💡 **Results**:
- Achieved significant accuracy with models like Passive Aggressive Classifier and SGD Classifier.
- Demonstrated superior adaptability and efficiency for real-time applications.

📈 **Applications**: Security and surveillance, user authentication, fraud detection, and more.
